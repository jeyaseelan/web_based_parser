  article: "California is cracking down on big flat-screen televisions because of energy usage. But has the super-size TV set become an object of vulgarity?Not so long ago, the television used to sit in the corner of the room, often shut away in a cabinet and only let out for limited periods of time. Everyone would huddle around to watch, often jostling for the best view.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nowadays it's big and bold, often dominating the room and commanding everyone's attention. Everyone can see it and all eyes are usually on it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Much has been written about the energy-guzzling nature of the bigger flat-screen TVs, but there is no doubt these sell at a furious rate.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Flat-screen TVs broadly come in two varieties - LCD and plasma. The first is smaller but getting bigger all the time, while the second already goes up to an almost cinematic 100in-plus. "

    Rising high through the polluted air of Guangzhou City in southern China is a 71-storey tower block which, according to its designers, will be the most energy-efficient in the world.
    
    Among a host of features designed either to make or save energy, the one that caught my eye was the shape of the Pearl River Tower itself.
    
    It is built in a curve, facing the prevailing winds. And it has been deliberately sculpted to increase the speed of that wind and force it through slots in the building where wind turbines will be located.
    
    Now, on many buildings, wind turbines are a waste of space because there's so much turbulence in cities. I heard an apocryphal story about a Japanese firm that installed a turbine which needed electric power to keep it turning to save the face of its would-be-green owners.
    
    	
    HOW THE TOWER SAVES ENERGY
    The Pearl River Tower in Guangzhou City stands 309m tall
    High temperature fuel cells complement the sustainable systems
    The outer skin controls glare and includes a photovoltaic system for energy
    Wind turbines generate power which can be fed to mechanical equipment
    The design incorporates a "high performance" building envelope
    An air displacement system relies on raised floors
    Cooling tower water passes through embedded tubes in the building
    
    But the American architects of this tower - SOM - insist that their experiments in a wind tunnel show this building will generate economically viable wind power.
    
    The vertical axis turbines will be located in the mechanical floors mandated by the Chinese government as emergency muster floors, so no usable office space will be lost.
    
    SOM claims that by thinking carefully about the use of space combined with energy-saving and energy-generating technology, they have been able to make unprecedented gains, so this building will potentially create as much energy as it uses.
    
    They are by no means the only architects to espouse the principle of integrated design, of course. But some observers believe that too many buildings are still being put up with a few bolt-on green features, without proper thought as to what could be achieved through a more considered approach.
    
    Take the cooling system in the tower. Most of the time, air conditioning is done by fat air ducts which gobble both energy and space between floors and ceilings. Here the cooling is done by a cool water system.
    
    The water flows in ducts through concrete beams, and cool air descends upon the toiling masses from cold water radiators in the ceilings.

  article: "Experts asked to review the US human spaceflight programme have given strong support to the use of commercial services to launch astronauts.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Augustine panel published its final report on Thursday and said America could find cheaper, faster successors to the shuttle in the private sector.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The US space agency is developing two new rockets and a crew capsule.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the committee has told President Barack Obama that these systems no longer meet the US's immediate needs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Speaking at a press conference in Washington DC, lead members of the panel said that if crew transport services to the International Space Station were passed to the private sector, it would free Nasa to work on more difficult and more exciting objectives.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We think this is a time to create a market for commercial firms to transport both cargo and humans between the Earth and low-Earth orbit,\" said Norm Augustine, the panel chairman and a former CEO of Lockheed Martin.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"While that is certainly not simple, it is much easier than going to Mars. We think Nasa would be better served to spend its money and its ability - which is immense - focusing on going beyond low-Earth orbit rather than running a trucking service to low-Earth orbit (LEO).\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Augustine: 'A new approach to conducting a spaceflight programme'\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Favoured solutions\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The panel published its summary findings in September. The full report adds considerable detail.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It will be used by President Obama, his chief scientist Dr John Holdren, and the new Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden, as they seek to put the agency on a sustainable future course. "

  article: "President Barack Obama has welcomed plans to force some companies which accepted government aid during the financial crisis to cut executive pay.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Firms paying bosses vast bonuses while getting state assistance offended people's values, the president said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Under Treasury plans, seven companies must slash the basic salaries of their 25 best-paid employees by up to 90%.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Separately the US Federal Reserve wants to prevent bank bosses from taking excessive risks while pursuing bonuses.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It proposes being able to veto the pay of any employee able to take risks that might threaten a firm's stability.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the Fed said it would not set pay caps or outlaw specific practices.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    'Offends values'\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Treasury plans apply to Bank of America, American International Group (AIG), Citigroup, General Motors, GMAC, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial - the seven companies that received the most aid from the US Treasury.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As well as its top earners facing a 90% pay cut, the total paid to each firm's 125 top earners would be halved under the proposals.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It does offend our values when executives of big financial firms that are struggling pay themselves huge bonuses even as they rely on extraordinary assistance to stay afloat,\" President Obama said. "

    I don't think it's just my imagination; diplomatic moves and announcements and challenges on climate change really are coming thicker and faster now than at any time since it first became an issue of political note 20 years ago.
    
    And no wonder, with the start of the UN climate summit just 45 days away, and various roads to Copenhagen taking routes through all kinds of capital cities and all kinds of fora.
    
    So I thought it would be worth taking a little time at the end of each week as the potentially seminal UN summit approaches to take stock of what's happened and ponder where it might all lead.
    
    Yvo de BoerWhat caught the imagination of many commentators this week were comments from UN climate convention executive secretary Yvo de Boer, to the effect that it is now "unrealistic" to expect a full treaty to be negotiated and agreed this year.
    
    "A fully fledged new international treaty... I do not think that is going to happen," he told the Financial Times newspaper.
    
    As he is constantly up close and personal with the main negotiators, Mr de Boer is just about as informed an observer as you can get.
    
    But it's difficult to see why his comments have caused so much consternation among environment groups and political commentators given that government officials and informed observers have been saying the same thing privately (and sometimes publically) for months.
    
    UK Climate Secretary Ed Miliband, speaking just before the Major Economies Forum (MEF) meeting that took place in London on Sunday and Monday, admitted as much.
    
    But he believes something important can still be achieved if it includes three basic elements: numerical mitigation targets for developed nations, agreement (including on figures) on financial support for developing countries, and agreed expressions of "ambition" from the richer developing countries on how they are prepared to curb rising emissions.
    
    For Mr de Boer, the essentials include targets for the rich, defined ambition for the developing world, and a firm timetable for tying up all the loose ends.
    
    As he is also on record as emphasising the necessity of agreement on finances, the hymn-sheets are not demonstrably different.

  article: "A former Tomorrow's World presenter has branded new energy reports \"insane\" after purpose-built 'eco homes' were given a low efficiency rating.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Lindsey Fallow said Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were made using a \"glorified spread sheet\" and did not recognise advanced technologies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It comes after a firm she is involved with scored low ratings on four new homes in South Lanarkshire.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Apex Developments said EPCs were \"not worth the paper they are written on\".\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It said the technologies it used to reduce carbon emissions at its Lethame Courtyard development on the outskirts of Strathaven had not been recognised in the assessment process.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The four new homes feature green technologies that the developers said reduced the carbon footprint of a large family home down that of a small one-bedroom flat.\r\n\
    \t\r\n\
    It seems insane to leave something so important down to what is essentially a glorified spread-sheet that only takes into account the basic technologies\r\n\
    Lindsey Fallow\r\n\
    Former Tomorrow's World presenter\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As well as extra wall insulation and under-floor heating, the houses have also been fitted with heat recovery systems and ground source heat pumps.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As part of the Home Information Packs, introduced in Scotland last year, EPCs are now required by law to be completed when properties are sold or rented out.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Former presenter Ms Fallow has been working with Apex on developing software which calculates how energy efficient certain technologies are.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She said: \"I was stunned when I saw the EPCs for these houses as I know the work that has gone into making them as 'green' as possible.\r\n\
    Pipes in one of the new houses\r\n\
    The houses feature energy efficient heating systems\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It seems insane to leave something so important down to what is essentially a glorified spread-sheet that only takes into account the basic technologies and does not recognise the more advanced ones.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It makes the whole process of getting these certificates seem like a complete waste of time.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Alan Simpson from Apex Developments told the BBC Scotland news website: \"We had done our own calculations which gave us a very high energy efficiency rating but when we had our EPC rating done it was not as good. "

    East Zone
    
    Jharkhand ended Assam's unbeaten run and continued their own at the Tata Digwadih Stadium in Dhanbad. Their seven-wicket win in a chase of 139 was set up by a 92-run opening stand in a little more than 13 overs between Rameez Nemat (62 not out) and captain Saurabh Tiwary (46). Assam struck back with three wickets in fairly quick succession, but Nemat stayed through to the end, and was supported by a quickfire cameo from wicketkeeper Shiv Gautham to win with 11 balls to spare. Assam were earlier boosted by a 53-ball 69 from Dheeraj Jadhav, but the effort was in vain as Jharkhand overhauled the target comfortably.
    
    Orissa handed Bengal their third consecutive defeat, beating them by seven runs in a tense contest. Paresh Patel bagged 3 for 29 to stop Bengal in their tracks after they had reached 121 for 4 in the 18th over while chasing 148. Dibyendu Chakrabarty top scored for Bengal with a 22-ball 37, and was backed up with contributions from the top and middle orders, but failed to see his team home. Pravanjan Mullick (34 not out) and Alok Sahoo (32 not out) had boosted Orissa to a match-winning score in their innings, adding 40 in quick time for the sixth wicket.
    
    Central Zone
    
    Madhya Pradesh reached the top of the Central Zone standings with a comfortable five-wicket win against Uttar Pradesh, who slipped to their second consecutive defeat, in Indore. Anand Rajan was the star player for MP, taking 4 for 26 to keep UP down to a chaseable 136. Only Mohammad Kaif, the captain, offered a significant challenger, making 57. In their reply, MP were boosted by a fiery 77 from opener Naman Ojha, who remained unbeaten to guide his team to victory with 13 balls to spare.

    \r\n\
    The new operating system was rolled out worldwide on 22 October.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Windows 7 was not included in its results from July to September, for which it reported net profits of $3.57bn (\xC2\xA32.18bn), down 18% from 2008.\r\n\

  article: "Young fishermen in Scotland face an uncertain future, with fish prices plummeting and skippers reaching their quotas too early. Some of them have decided to do something about it and are hoping the EU can help secure their livelihoods.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As crews unload their catches for the early morning fish market in Fraserburgh, 15-year-old Alexander West looks out longingly across the sea.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A night of heavy storms means he won't get to go out on his father's boat, The Virtuous. It'll be a day of cleaning and maintenance work instead.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He told Newsbeat: \"I just want to go to sea because it's all I've seen growing up.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I've just seen my dad doing it, my granddad doing it, my great granddad doing it. It's been in the family for hundreds of years. It's what my town is based around and I just want to go away and do it.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But Alexander is unusual. He's one of only two in his class at school to choose a career as a fisherman. He's got another year left, then it's the start of a new life out at sea fishing for prawns.\r\n\
    'Way of life'\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He says: \"It's not just a job, it's a way of life. If you've been brought up in the fishing industry, it's all you know.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It's teenagers like Alexander who are rare in this industry. So rare in fact, there's a worry if more don't start taking an interest, it could mean serious problems for fishing towns like Fraserburgh.\r\n\
    Bertie Armstrong Bertie Armstrong says the industry needs young people\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bertie Armstrong is the chief executive of the Scottish Fisherman's Federation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He said: \"If young people don't join the industry and we don't make it attractive then the industry will go into a downward spiral and towns like Fraserburgh will by default die.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"That's a criminal act when we have a world class, renewable, accessible source on our doorstep which is ours to harvest.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Between 1997 and 2007, the number of fishermen in the north east of Scotland fell by 40.7%. In Fraserburgh alone, that figure was closer to 50%.\r\n\
    Early quotas\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Part of the problem is money. Fish prices have plummeted in the last year because of the recession. In turn many skippers have had to catch more to meet the bills and have met this year's quota already.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If you look out onto the harbour in Fraserburgh and in neighbouring Peterhead, several cod boats are moored up. They're forbidden to catch any more and so will lie dormant for the next two months until the new EU quotas come in in January.\r\n\

    Alexander's father Sandy on his son's passion for the fishing industry\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Seventeen-year-old Ryan Mcrobbie's dream is to become a skipper. Fishing's been in his family for six generations. He's a crew member on a boat that's already met its cod limits for the year.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We've had to change to prawns just to try and make a living and make some money,\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Fishermen may be angry about these strict EU rules but there is a reason for them. Although the cod stocks in the North Sea are starting to recover, they're still below the safety levels.\r\n\
    Jeopardising stocks\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Louize Hill is the marine policy officer at WWF Scotland. She said: \"In order to ensure no species of fish is threatened due to over fishing, it is vital scientific assessments are used to set quotas.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Setting quotas above scientific advice or catching more fish than advised will jeopardise the long term survival of fish stocks and therefore the future of the fishing fleets.\"\r\n\
    Carol Macdonald Carol Macdonald says it's a fight to preserve a way of life\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But for skippers and crew members taking a break in Angela's tea bar in Fraserburgh, the promise of harsher quotas to come next year is also a problem.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Alexander's passion for the fishing industry is a worry for his father Sandy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He said: \"I would have preferred it if he had stayed on at college and done a bit of engineering and maybe got another job. But fishing's in the blood and that's what he wants to do.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Which is why Alexander, Ryan and a few of their friends are meeting the Scottish Fisheries Secretary, Richard Lochhead.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    They're hoping he can work with the EU to secure their livelihoods.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Carol Macdonald from the campaign group, Cod Crusaders is going with them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She said: \"At the end of the day we're simply fighting to preserve a way of life within traditional fishing communities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We need those in power to make sure there's going to be an industry here for Alexander and many to follow in his footsteps.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For teenagers like Ryan and Alexander, they've seen their families and other fishermen struggle but it's something they care too much about to leave behind. "

Dhoni was apparently hit on the back of his left knee off a Munaf Patel delivery, and having played one more ball, he limped off the practice area on Friday. An ice pack was promptly put on the affected area, but he didn't appear to be in too much pain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I should be alright tomorrow,\" Dhoni said. \"But have to wait and see how it feels in the morning.\" There is no reserve wicketkeeper in the squad of 15 named for the series and Dinesh Karthik, who was the back-up during the Champions Trophy in South Africa, had not received any call from the BCCI until late on Friday night.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The news does not augur well for the Indian team, who have been hit a spate of injuries to players recently. While Virender Sehwag had suffered a shoulder injury, which kept him out of the the World Twenty20 and Champions Trophy as well as the subsequent tours of West Indies and Sri Lanka, Yuvraj Singh had injured the the little finger on his right hand during the Champions Trophy. Both players have recovered since, and have been picked for the Australia series. Also, Suresh Raina had suffered a hairline fracture to his thumb, and Zaheer Khan looks to have worked his way back to fitness after picking up a shoulder injury. "

    \"It's like finding a T. Rex fossil that's much older than any other known,\" said Dr Ben Maughan, from the University of Bristol.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He added: \"One fossil might just fit in with our understanding of dinosaurs, but if you found many more you would have to start rethinking how dinosaurs evolved.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"The same is true for galaxy clusters and our understanding of cosmology.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    'Oldest possible'\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Galaxy clusters are the Universe's largest objects bound by gravity, and experts hope that the findings will help them understand better how the cosmos has changed over time.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    JKCS041 is at the farthest point at which scientists think galaxy clusters can exist in the early Universe.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Stefano Andreon, of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Milan, Italy, said: \"This object is close to the distance limit expected for a galaxy cluster.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We don't think gravity can work fast enough to make galaxy clusters much earlier.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Scientists have detected what they believe to be the light from individual galaxies out to about 13 billion light-years. A group of telescopes this year also caught what was thought to be the flash from the cataclysmic explosion of a giant star at a similar distance.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The paper describing the JKCS041 results will appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. "

    In a light-hearted essay, Clive James takes a look at Montaigne, golf-ball crisps and our attitude towards climate change sceptics.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What do I know? Montaigne asked himself, and in answering that question during the course of several volumes of great essays he touched on many subjects. But he never touched on the subject of the golf-ball potato crisp.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As far as I know, this essay I am writing now is the first ever devoted to the subject of Montaigne's relationship to the golf-ball potato crisp, and my essay starts from my certain knowledge that he never ate one. Or anyway my almost certain knowledge. There's a difference, which I shall try to bring out.\r\n\

    But more of the golf-ball potato crisp in a moment. Let's get back to Montaigne and his attitude to knowledge. He was a sceptic. He didn't want to take things just on trust. As it happened, there were lots of things he did take on trust. "

    Sachin Tendulkar will complete 20 years on the international circuit during the series against Australia \xC2\xA9 Associated Press\r\n\

    \r\n\
    One-day international cricket in India is an anomaly. While the world - including players like Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar - seems sated with the 50-over game, especially with meaningless seven-match bilateral series, the upcoming contest between India and Australia is likely to be received well by the home audience. Three-odd commercials squeezed in after each over works well for the broadcasters, international cricket in smaller centres works well for the public there.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Over the next three weeks, though, we will know if times are changing in India as they are in the rest of the world. The Champions League Twenty20, with its largely thin crowds, will have just finished when the two top-ranked teams start their series - only ODIs, no Tests nor Twenty20s. Three Australian players, representing New South Wales in the Champions League, will reach Vadodara on Saturday afternoon, having finished their final late Friday night and travelled about 1100 km north-west, and start a match at 9.00 am on Sunday. That could have been the fate of three more Australians, had Victoria won their semi-final, or of a couple of Indians had one of the IPL teams made it that far.\r\n\
    \r\n  It's not just the players, of course, who are threatened by fatigue. Will cricket's biggest and most consistent market show signs it has had enough? Will the seemingly insatiable public turn its back on a calendar fast becoming a blur? If so, it will never have been more justified in its reaction given the manner in which one tournament now merges seamlessly into another without a thought for the importance some of them deserve.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It's a disturbing backdrop to a series that is effectively a tussle for top spot on the ICC rankings - especially when the two sides have spent the last two years playing hard, exciting cricket while building up a keen rivalry. When Australia came to India for four Tests last year there was both time and previous for the fans to slowly build up to the series. Then again the Indian cricket fan is a confounding creature: Mohali and Nagpur drew abysmal crowds and Delhi's public turned up only when it was clear they would be witnessing Anil Kumble's farewell. Perhaps the build-up doesn't matter here, but it could be tempting fate to start a seven-match contest 33 hours after the Champions League ends.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Surely, though, this will not mirror the drab series Australia went through in England. Surely, once the matches start, sub-plots will emerge. Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle will bowl bouncers to Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli. Harbhajan Singh, up against his favourite opponents, will look for redemption after a poor personal Champions Trophy - itself an aberration for a bowler much improved after Anil Kumble's retirement. Ishant Sharma, who tormented Ricky Ponting enough to find a mention in his book as one of the more exciting contests he has been through, will now be targeted and will have to show what stuff he is made of. He is struggling in the shorter versions, he is low on confidence, and he doesn't have a bowling coach.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \tShaun Marsh at a media call, Hobart, January 17, 2009\r\n\
    Shaun Marsh, after that blockbuster IPL and the subsequent injury, will get a decent run in national colours \xC2\xA9 Getty Images\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Shaun Marsh, after that blockbuster IPL and the subsequent injury, will get a decent run in national colours, an opportunity rightfully his after Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist retired. Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh will make their comebacks, and that is as good a reason as any to watch the games. Shane Watson again is on the verge of realising his true potential at international level. At some time during the series, Sachin Tendulkar will finish 20 years in international cricket. Amid all that, what fun it would be if the unheralded players - Doug Bollinger, Ben Hilfenhaus, Jon Holland, Sudeep Tyagi - prove to be the difference.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It helps that there are no favourites going into the series. India's batting looks much better with Sehwag and Yuvraj back, and the familiar lower pitches on offer. The fast bowling, in Zaheer Khan's absence, will be scrutinised again; the fielding will remain the area that Australia will look to capitalise on.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Michael Clarke's absence will mean Ponting and Michael Hussey will have extra responsibility in the middle order. That apart, Australia will seek a continuation of their ODI turnaround after the losses to South Africa home and away. They have now beaten Pakistan and England in bilateral series and have defended their Champions Trophy undefeated, winning 14 out of their last 17 matches. But the conditions will test them and the Indian batsmen will be the toughest to contain among their recent opposition.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Both teams, in different ways, are in transitional phases. Both teams can claim to have been the best ODI team over the past two years. If they can sufficiently engage the crowds over the next three weeks, despite the overdose of cricket that precedes it, a fresh debate on the feasibility of ODIs will need to be started.\r\n"

  article: "(CBS)  For years now, American women's tennis has been summed up in one word: Williams. The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, have been champions for nearly a decade.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now there is a new American hero - a teenager who today pulled off her third straight upset at the U.S. Open. CBS News correspondent Kelly Wallace has the story of Melanie Oudin.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Playing with a mix of confidence and determination well beyond her 17 years, Melanie Oudin's fiery brand of tennis has won the hearts of American tennis fans. She's the hottest sensation at this year's tournament.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"She's a bulldog,\" one fan said. \"She never gives up.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Today's win over the Russian 13th seed Nadia Petrova was her Oudin's third straight upset of a ranked player, and overwhelmed her parents and twin sister. It makes her the youngest American woman to make the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open since Serena Williams a decade ago.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Photo essay: Melanie Oudin\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"This is good for American tennis\" Oudin said. \"I'm so happy to be in my first quarterfinal in a grand-slam ever!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Hailing from the suburbs of Atlanta, Oudin proved herself to be a true Georgia bulldog - losing the first set and almost the match, before coming back from behind.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The spunky teen, who just a year ago was ranked 212th, so believes she can write a Cinderella story this year that she's wearing her motto - \"Believe\" - on her pink and yellow sneakers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"She gave me a couple free points and I started playing better and getting my confidence and believing I could do it and I did,\" she said after the match.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Even before her victory, Oudin has been called the future of American tennis, who could pick up the mantle one day from 29-year-old Venus and 27-year-old Serena Williams.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I think she's a breath of fresh air,\" said CBS Sports anchor Mary Jo Fernandez. \"She gets giddy and emotional - and she's just so excited and you see it in her eyes.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For Oudin the future is here. The 5-foot-6 teen knows if she wants to make real history, she'll have to knock off a few more big names.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It's not about size, I don't think, and power,\" she said. \"It's about how tough you are mentally and how smart you play on the court.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As her tennis friends cheered her on back home in Georgia, the wide-eyed Oudin faces something she's hasn't yet encountered in her dream run - great expectations. "

  article: "Mobile phone maker Nokia is suing Apple to try to extract royalty payments, an analyst has suggested.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nokia said on Thursday that it was suing Apple for infringing patents on mobile phone technology for the iPhone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster estimates that the Finnish company might be looking to force royalty payments of 1-2% on every iPhone sold.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    With more than 30 million sold, that would work out to $6 to $12 per phone sold, or as much as $400m.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    That would be a relatively small amount compared with Apple's income.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Apple recently reported profits of $1.67bn (\xC2\xA31bn) for the three months to 26 September - partly due to a 7% growth in iPhone sales.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nokia did not say in the lawsuit what form of penalties it was seeking.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    'Uncertain' resolution\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mr Munster, a respected Apple watcher, called the maximum figure of $12 a phone \"unlikely\" and said even if it was enforced in court, it \"would not change our positive thesis on the iPhone and Apple\".\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Ultimately, the resolution is uncertain,\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    An Apple spokesman told the BBC that the firm did not comment on pending litigation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The 10 alleged patent infringements, which apply to all models of the iPhone since its launch in 2007, involve wireless data, speech coding, security and encryption.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nokia accused Apple of \"trying to get a free ride on the back of Nokia's innovation\". "

  article: "A new mobile phone charger that will work with any handset has been approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations body.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Industry body the GSMA predicts that 51,000 tonnes of redundant chargers are generated each year.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Currently most chargers are product or brand specific, so people tend to change them when they upgrade to a new phone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, the new energy-efficient chargers can be kept for much longer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The GSMA also estimates that they will reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 13.6m tonnes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"This is a significant step in reducing the environmental impact of mobile charging,\" said Malcolm Johnson, director of ITU's Telecommunication Standardisation Bureau.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Universal chargers are a common-sense solution that I look forward to seeing in other areas.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The charger has a micro-USB port at the connecting end, using similar technology to digital cameras.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is not compulsory for manufacturers to adopt the new chargers but the ITU says that some have already signed up to it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We are planning to launch the universal charger internationally during the first half of 2010,\" Aldo Liguori, spokesperson for Sony Ericsson told the BBC.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We will roll it out with new products as they launch.\" "

  article: "n normal circumstances John Kelly would never have dreamed of lying to his dying mother.Bedridden after several strokes she lived in hope, waiting for the results of the Saville Inquiry into the Bloody Sunday shootings in Londonderry on 30 January 1972.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    British paratroops opened fire on a demo in the Bogside. Fourteen people died, including Mrs Kelly's 17-year-old son Michael.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She believed her son and many others were maligned by claims that the soldiers were firing on gunmen and bombers, and by the Widgery Inquiry in 1972 which nationalists saw as a whitewash.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mr Kelly remembers his mother's reaction to the announcement by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1998 of a new inquiry under Lord Saville.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"She was over the moon,\" he told The Report.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"On the first day the inquiry opened all of the families marched from William Street to the Guildhall. My mother was at the front and she was really, really proud of the fact that we did have a new inquiry into Bloody Sunday.\"\r\n\
    \t\r\n\
    LISTEN TO THE REPORT\r\n\
    BBC Radio 4, Thursday 15 October at 2000 BST\r\n\
    Or download the podcast.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But 11 years on the process has become the longest running and most expensive public inquiry in British history costing the taxpayer approximately \xC2\xA3200m.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother's wish\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When it became obvious that his mother would not survive to see the inquiry's conclusions, Mr Kelly decided it was time to put her mind at rest.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Every day she would ask what is happening with the inquiry,\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"She died in June 2004 and a few months before, I told her - because we knew she was coming to the end of her time - I told her Michael's name had been cleared and she said, 'that's good son, that's grand'.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Last month Lord Saville wrote to the bereaved families saying his final report had been put back again until next spring, citing an unexpected delay with page numbering and cross referencing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The mammoth inquiry has heard from 900 witnesses in person and received more than 2,500 witness statements. "

  article: "(AP)  SAN DIEGO (AP) - Rookie Ty Lawson had 29 points, six assists and five steals to help the Denver Nuggets beat the Los Angeles Lakers 119-105 on Friday night in the exhibition finale for both teams.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Nuggets (4-4) played without Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups after coach George Karl gave them the night off, while the Lakers (6-2) were without 7-footers Pau Gasol (strained right hamstring) and Andrew Bynum (strained right shoulder).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Kobe Bryant played only 9:51, all in the first quarter, and scored six points for the Lakers, while Sasha Vujacic had 18 points.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The game was punctuated by eight technical fouls and two flagrant fouls from the replacement officials. The Lakers' Lamar Odom and Denver's Chris Andersen had to be separated after a rebound battle led to a pushing and shoving match in the second quarter.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    On Friday night, the NBA's regular referees agreed on a two-year contract to end the lockout.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Five technicals and both flagrant fouls were called in the second quarter, which ended with the Nuggets leading 57-49.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    J.R. Smith of the Nuggets had 16 of his 18 points and Kenyon Martin all 12 of his in the first half. Smith had seven assists in a game-high 40 minutes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Lawson, a 5-foot-11 guard from 2009 NCAA champion North Carolina, scored 16 points in the fourth quarter when the Nuggets pulled out to a 107-86 lead with 5:05 remaining. He was 8 of 12 from the field and 13 of 16 from the free-throw line.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Andersen added 15 points and nine rebounds and Arron Afflalo had 12 points for the Nuggets.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Denver shot 57 percent from the field (45 of 79) while the Lakers hit 45.6 percent (36 of 79). "
